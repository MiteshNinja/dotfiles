# Welcome home.

My repository for all my personal tweaks and settings.

I've seen a lot of people recommending forking dotfile repos from
others which is totally a cool idea but they usually contain a lot
of extra stuff which I don't require.

# Included configs:

* xfce4

# Notes

Please edit the following files if you are cloning/forking this repository:

* .gitconfig [user.name and user.email]
