# Welcome to oxalorgs home base - ark.

Less is more.
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.

## Installation

You can either run `install.sh` which will run `setup.sh` from every folder,
or you can manually run setup of the folders you want to install.

## Configurations currently in-use:

* zsh - make it more lean
* vim - Started using vim again (jan 2017)
* nvim
* csgo
* logkeys
* git
* ~~xfce4~~ I've switched back to Unity (dec 2016)
* ~~atom~~ - Don't use it anymore, too slow
* ~~tmux~~ - Don't use it anymore, too complex

## Notes

Please edit the following files if you are cloning/forking this repository:

* git/.gitconfig [user.name and user.email]
